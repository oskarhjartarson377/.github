## 💡 Approach to Development  
I believe in clean, maintainable code and a collaborative development process. My focus is on writing efficient algorithms, designing robust architectures, and ensuring seamless user experiences. I’m a strong advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration to maintain high-quality standards.  

## 📚 Learning & Interests  
I’m always exploring new technologies and improving my skills. Currently, I’m diving deeper into machine learning with Python and experimenting with WebAssembly (Wasm) for performance-critical applications. I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects and sharing knowledge through technical blogs.
